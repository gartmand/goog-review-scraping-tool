# SCRAPE

This is a tool that can be used to scrape google reviews and convert the data into JSON

## Setup

- Clone Repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/iarobinson/review_scraping_tool` into your terminal
- Change directories into the folder `cd review_scraping_tool`
- Install dependencies `npm i`
- Run the application `node scrape.js`


## Caveat

This doesn't work right now and you need to adjust the selectors based on your own google map experience. It's a bit tricky, but I'm confident this is close to working.
